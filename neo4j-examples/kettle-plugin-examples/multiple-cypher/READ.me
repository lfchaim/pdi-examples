This example reads a bunch of cypher statements from a file.
It then splits the list up into individual statements to execute.
You split on a semi-colon (;) on a new line.
Empty statements comprised of only spaces (newlines, tabs, spaces, ...) are avoided. 

You would typically add a parameter called FILE to this transformation and replace the hardcoded filename (in Statements) with that.
This way you can re-use the same transformation to execute multiple files with Cypher statements.
