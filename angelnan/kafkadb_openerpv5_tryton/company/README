Company
=======

When you create a new database, you must create a company. At the end, this company create this values:

 * party_party. id=1
 * company_company. id=1. party=1

Usually OpenERP (v5) works a single company (one company). If you use multicompany, after migration, 
you need review ID from party/company is the same than OpenERP.
