# PDI NoSQL Samples

A set of sample Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) transformations that integrate to REST and NoSQL non-relational data sources.

These samples also expose non-relational sources as a PDI Data Service, enabling Pentaho Business Analytics to be used
to create dashboards over MongoDB, MarkLogic, and other sources.
